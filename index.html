                        <p>Randi Markham was born October 12, 1983, in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. Her childhood was colored by her relationship with
                        her parents, Sandra and Jesse, and her sister, Robin.</p>

                            <p>By the age of 17, her high school days were drawing to an end and she started exploring options for her future.
                            Looking to guidance from a family friend, Randi discovered the benefits offered by the US Army. Still in high school,
                            Randi enlisted with the Army Reserves in February of 2001.</p>

                            <p> She headed to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX where all Military working dogs are trained. In the
                            training program, instructors match each trainer with 2 dogs. At a certain point in the program, the trainer decides
                            which of the two will go on and continue training with them, and which will return and try again with the next
                            training class. After rigorous training, Randi and her dog passed their exam and were released to work as a Military
                            Police K9 unit. These units work as a regular police force, with jurisdiction over the assigned military base. </p>

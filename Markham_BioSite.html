        <h3 id="Youth">The Early Years</h3>
    
        <p>Randi Markham was born October 12, 1983, in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. Her childhood was colored by her relationship with her parents, Sandra and Jesse, and her sister, Robin.
         By the age of 17, her high school days were drawing to an end and she started exploring options for her future. Looking to guidance from a family friend, Randi discovered
         the benefits offered by the US Army. Still in high school, Randi enlisted with the Army Reserves in February of 2001.</p>

        <h3 id="Career">New Beginnings</h3>
   
        <p> After graduating high school, Randi made the decision to make the move from the Army Reserves, to the Army's Military Police. She continued to train as a soldier, and in 2005
         she was deployed to Iraq for 16 months. During this deployment, she worked in detainee operations and convoy security. After her deployment ended, she returned home where she was
         referred to join the Military Working Dog Program as a dog handler. </p>

        <h3 id="Training">A Dog's Life</h3>
                       
        <p> She headed to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX where all Military working dogs are trained. In the training program, instructors match each trainer with 2 dogs. At a
         certain point in the program, the trainer decides which of the two will go on and continue training with them, and which will return and try again with the next training class.</p>

           </figure>
        <p>After rigorous training, Randi and her dog passed their exam and were released to work as a Military Police K9 unit. These units work as a regular police force, with jurisdiction
         over the assigned military base. </p>

    </p>        
                             

     <p>In 2008, she was deployed to Iraq for a second time, for a period of 12 months. This time she went as a dog handler team, trained to find explosives. Upon her return from this 
        deployment, she was "voluntold" to go into recruiting. In 2010, she started her work as a US Army recruiter. Randi quickly moved up the ladder and by 2015, she was a recruiting 
        station commander in mid-Missouri. In August, she met the love of her life, Rochelle, and proposed to her on Christmas of the same year. By the following summer, the two were married. </p>
 
    <h3 id="Present">Present Day</h3> 
    
    <p>In 2018, the newlyweds, moved their family to Louisiana, so that Randi could pursue her career on the operations level of recruiting. They moved with Rochelle's daughter, Camilla, and
        their animals. The family shares a deep love for animals, and have adopted two dogs, Luna and Lola, and 2 cats, Harlow and Sadie. Camilla also has a ball python, of which Randi is 
        admittedly "not a fan". </p>
